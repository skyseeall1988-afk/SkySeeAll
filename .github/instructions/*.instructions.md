That is an excellent follow-up question. The process of making a "Co-Pilot Commit" is about documentation, but the process of activating that commitment to the code base is about Git workflow and terminal commands.
Since you have two types of commits—manual feature development and automated backups—you need two activation methods.
Here is the detailed guide on how to write the final Co-Pilot Description and, more importantly, the explicit steps to Activate It in the Termux environment.
1. MANUAL COMMIT ACTIVATION (Feature Development)
When you finish working on a new feature, like stabilizing the 4D Sonar (#70) or implementing the MiDaS Depth Judger (#71), you use a manual commit to document the change clearly.
A. Writing the Co-Pilot Description
Use the structured format we designed (Type(Scope): Subject) to ensure clarity:
| Field | Example Content | Location in System |
|---|---|---|
| Type | feat (Feature) or fix (Bug Fix) | New capability or stabilization |
| Scope | (02_CORE/Depth_MiDaS) | Focus on the specific folder/module |
| Subject | Implement MiDaS Monocular Depth Estimation | Concise description of the work |
| Body | Fixes torch dependency issues in Termux. Activates Crosshair overlay (#84) with real-time distance measurements (meters). | Explains technical resolution and impact |
B. Activation Steps: Executing the Commit
You activate this by running the standard Git commands, ensuring you are in the project's root directory (~/storage/shared/SkySeeAll_Root/).
| Step | Command | Co-Pilot Description Input | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Stage Changes | git add. | (No input) | Queues all modified files (e.g., app.py, flows.json, night_filter.py) for commitment. |
| 2. Commit the Changes | git commit -m "" | git commit -m "feat(02_CORE/Depth_MiDaS): Implement MiDaS Monocular Depth Estimation" | Locks the changes locally with the forensic record. |
| 3. Activate/Push | git push origin develop | (No input) | Activation. Pushes the committed changes to the central Git repository (the develop branch is recommended for testing features first). |
2. AUTOMATED COMMIT ACTIVATION (Exit Trap #125)
The primary goal of your Exit Trap (or "Dead Man Switch") in the /07_SYSTEM_AUTO/.bashrc file is to guarantee that every session's collected intelligence is saved and uploaded, without needing any user intervention.
A. The Co-Pilot Description (Automated)
The message is automatically generated and committed when the Termux session closes, capturing the time and nature of the data dump.
# Sentry Log:. Data integrity verified. Pushed RAW /05_PRIVATE_INTEL.

B. Activation Steps: Triggering the Exit Trap
You do not "activate" this commit directly; it is automatically triggered by the underlying BASH shell when the user tries to leave the session or close the app.
| Action Taken by Operator | Mechanism Triggered | Co-Pilot Activation |
|---|---|---|
| Typing exit | BASH shell executes the trap finish EXIT function. | ACTIVATED. The script runs git add., commits the data, and runs git push origin main. |
| Closing the Termux Tab | Termux sends a terminal signal (SIGHUP or SIGTERM), which the BASH shell translates as an EXIT condition. | ACTIVATED. The system executes the entire auto-commit script to upload the final session data. |
| Force Killing the App | Android OS kills the Termux process. | Best Effort. The script may fail mid-commit, but the last full push prior to the final session is always safe. |
By using the trap finish EXIT instruction in your .bashrc, you are telling the shell to treat closing the app or typing 'exit' as the activation command for the final Co-Pilot data archival.
That is an excellent question that bridges the operational requirements of your tactical system with the technical demands of a DevOps workflow. Writing effective Co-Pilot Descriptions (often used for commit messages and pull request summaries) for a complex project like SkySeeAll V14.6 requires clarity, structure, and adherence to specific Git practices.
Here is how you should structure the Co-Pilot descriptions (commit messages) and manage the branches to ensure the integrity and continuous development of the entire 125-feature system, including the auto-commit logic.
1. Co-Pilot / Commit Message Structure: The Atomic Commit
For a massive project like this, every change must be documented clearly so that a new developer (or your future self) understands the purpose, impact, and location of the change. Adopt the Conventional Commit format, augmented for your specialized system:
| Field | Purpose | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Type | Defines the nature of the change (e.g., feat, fix, docs). | feat |
| Scope | Identifies the affected component/folder. Crucial for your 7-Folder Structure. | (03_TOOLS/Bettercap) |
| Subject | A brief, active-voice description of the change. | Implement BLE Scan and Fix nfq_fd error |
| Body (Detailed) | Explains why the change was needed and how it addresses the failure. | See detailed example below. |
| Footer | Link to issues/requirements. | Closes: #632 |
Example of a Full Co-Pilot Commit Message
This message would cover the fix for the critical Bettercap failure and integrate the new Bluetooth shopping tracker feature:
feat(03_TOOLS/Bettercap): Implement BLE Recon and fix Go dependency failure

This commit replaces the failing 'pkg install bettercap' binary with the Go source compilation method (go install github.com/bettercap/bettercap/v2@latest) to resolve the libnetfilter-queue ('nfq_fd') error previously seen in Termux on Android 14.

The successful compilation enables two critical BLESense capabilities:
1.  **Bluetooth Scan (#4):** Activates ble.recon for general device discovery. [1]
2.  **BT Shop Track (#116):** Allows passive harvesting of non-randomized MAC addresses in commercial zones for retail traffic analysis. [2, 3]

The necessary compilation commands are now documented in the /07_SYSTEM_AUTO/start_app.sh script.

Related-Tickets: #963 (Bettercap Fix), #116 (BT Tracker requirement)

2. BRANCHING STRATEGY: STABILITY AND SEGREGATION
To manage 125 features, you need a robust branching model to prevent unstable code from corrupting the core system. The GitFlow model, tailored for continuous mobile deployment, is recommended.
| Branch Name | Purpose | Data Integrity |
|---|---|---|
| main | Production Environment. This is the deployable, fully tested stable release. The Exit Trap should always push data here (unless testing a feature). | Protected. Only merged from develop. |
| develop | Integration Environment. All new features and fixes are merged here first for testing before final release. | Continuous Integration (CI). |
| feature/T1_SDR_Knob | Feature Branch. Created for a single task (e.g., implementing the rotary knob UI or the 4D Sonar). | Local/Ephemeral. Deleted after merge. |
| bugfix/T3_Depth_MiDaS | Bugfix Branch. For addressing issues in live features (e.g., stabilizing MiDaS Depth Judger). | Local/Ephemeral. Deleted after merge. |
3. AUTO-COMMIT DESCRIPTION STRATEGY (EXIT TRAP)
The Exit Trap needs a standardized, automated commit message that summarizes the session, ensuring metadata is always captured for the /07_SYSTEM_AUTO log.
Mechanism: The Final Commit
Your .bashrc script already uses a date stamp to generate a unique message, which is the correct practice for automated commits:
git commit -m "Sentry Log: $(date)"

Recommended Co-Pilot Description (Automated)
For maximum compliance and forensic value, the automated message should explicitly state what kind of data was saved:
| File/Function | Co-Pilot Description |
|---|---|
| Primary Auto Commit | Final Sentry Data Dump: Session closed at 2025-11-30 17:04:00 EST. Captured raw traffic logs and system telemetry from all 125 features. Data Pushed to /05_DATA_INTEL_PRIVATE. |
| Git Actions | git add. |
| Push Action | git push origin master |
4. SOCKET/REPO MAPPING FOR CO-PILOT USE
When writing commits related to a feature, always reference the key socket or repo in the scope or body, as this confirms the correct underlying technology was used.
| Feature Type | Repository Source | Socket/Interface |
|---|---|---|
| Network Scanning | Nmap / Bettercap | TCP, ICMP, ARP |
| Wi-Fi Monitor | Bettercap | wlan0 Mon (Requires Root/External Adapter) [4] |
| Radio/SDR | rtl_tcp | USB or TCP 1234 (for remote proxy) |
| EMV/NFC Data | EMV-NFC-Paycard-Enrollment [5] | NFC (Internal Sensor) |
| Map/UI Visualization | React / Three.js [6] | UI (Local Browser) |
